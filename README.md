## Text Markers:

* __Bold__ : use "**" or "__" at the beginning and at the end: **Word**, __Word2__
* __Italic__ : use only one "*" or "_" : *Hi*, _Hi_
* __Across Line__ : use "~~" : ~~Word~~
***
## Titles:

*Each title level carries a number of "#".
---
## Mixing:

* We can also mix : Italic + Bold = __*Word*__

## Ordered List:

  1. Test
  1. Test
  1. Test
  
  (It doesn't matter the number order, It'll always display as an increasing order)
  
  (Also we have to keep in mind that we can nestle a line to another by adding 3 spaces)
  
---
## Unordered List:

  * Test
  * Test
  * Test
  
  *(As the same as in ordered list, we nestle a line to another one by adding 3 spaces)

##  List of Duties:

- [ ] First Duty
- [ ] Second Duty
- [x] Third Duty

  (Do not forget to add spaces inside all of the code, otherwise it does not work)
  
  (If you already finished one of your duties you can use "- [x]" to set as ended)

 ## Adding Links:
 
 Write something like this: "[Your Title].(URL)" --> Do not you the "." though.
 
 (We have got a description [Wich is up to you], and a (URL))
 
 Example: [My Profile](https://github.com/joaoigorvidal)
